In-platform marketing dashboards often provide heuristic statistics on conversion attribution using models such as first touch or last touch. Some such as Facebook or Google provide "data-driven" multi-touch attribution models. However, marketing teams may find it difficult to import touchpoint interactions from other channels into these platforms to get an accurate multi-touch attribution report. More commonly touchpoints are streamed into a centralized data warehouse from a variety of marketing platforms. This package aims to provide multi-touch attribution for marketing teams which have their aggregated touchpoint data in one data warehouse.
